# Productivity Made Easy

An unfinished Android App usage tracker that stores its data using an online API connected to a MySQL database in order to synchronise cross platform.


## Information

I originally made this as my final project to graduate from highschool. This project was very rushed, this version of the app, the Android Studio version, got abandoned and is therefore not functional, though the implemented features do work.

Although it has some functionalities, it is not well designed as I focused exclusively on programming the required features.

The API used to be hosted for free on Heroku but they currently do not offer the free tier anymore so the API is therefore offline. The MySQL database hosting itself was provided by my highschool which I now graduated from and is therefore also offline.

## Rewrite

I'm currently working on a complete rewrite of the project since I do believe this project had a lot of potential that it has not yet reached. It will be a very different tech stack so this repository will therefore not be updated but I will link the new project once I have a public repository for it.


## Disclaimer

This version of the application was abandoned early on and therefore only login, register and change password functions have been implemented.

The features that did get implemented work better in this version than they do in the [C# version](https://github.com/kaajjaak/PMEMobileLegacy), however I was able to reuse code from the Desktop version in the C# version, which is why I chose to migrate.
